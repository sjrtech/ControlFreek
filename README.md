# ControlFreek
What is Control Freek? An electric guitar effects pedal controller.  
Similar in function to Boss(tm) ES-8, BUT the Control Freek uses two pieces: a breakout box and a stompbox to allow the effects pedals to be mounted on a shelf or rack drawer AT ARMS REACH - WITHOUT BENDING OVER TO TURN KNOBS and still providing foot switch controls.
